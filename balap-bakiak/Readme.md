So here I am creating a project about a racing game.
Although this uses a website rather than Unity, Godot,
or another game engine, if I had a team that could create sprite designs and had an APK sprite,
I might be able to make a game that is better than this Godot-based game (game engine).
so yeah Basically, I need someone majoring in visual communication design who likes games and has APK Sprite.
